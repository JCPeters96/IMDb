# IMDb webscraping
These documents are meant for practice in webscraping. I started with 2 projects: 

One, scraping the IMDb "Top 1000" list and try to give answer on the following questions:
  - Which movie characteristics are needed to enter in the top 1000?
  - What genre is most popular?
  - Which actors are presented the most in the IMDb top 1000
  - Statistics about IMDb ratings / Metascore


secondly, scraping all movies from IMDb with >1.000 votes, whereby I also want to scrape the demand of Netflix, Videoland, Disney + and Amazon Prime to ad as a variable in the dataset. With this dataset I want to make a clean dashboard with easy filters to give a 'movie advice' (e.g., give me the movies with an IMDb score of 8+, genre = drama or action, actor = Al Pacino, year = 1990+, and it should be available on Netflix)

What should still be done:
  - Analyzing the scraped Top 1000 list
  - Scraping Netflix / Videoland / Disney + / Amazon Prime demand
